## Information Retrieval Project

* Probabilistic IR System:
	* Write an IR system able to answer, using a probabilistic model(BIM or BM25);
	* Free-form text queries;
	* The system must allow relevance feedback;
	* Also the use of pseudo-relevance feedback is possible;
	* Evaluate the system on a set of test queries.
